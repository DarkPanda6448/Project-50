                    <p>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.</p>
                    <p>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</p>
                    <p>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.</p>

                    <p> Almost half of all known species of Chameleons live in Madagascar. </p>
                    <p> Chameleons mainly change color to communicate or regulate body temperature. </p>
                    <p> Unlike many lizards, Chameleons can't regrow their tails. </p>

                <p> Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902. </p>
                <p> The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff in 1903. </p>
                <p> Up to 2,000 U.S. specialty teddy bear stores sell millions of them every year. </p>
